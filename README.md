#RD-8 MIDI Splitter
The "RD-8 MIDI Splitter" script is designed to simplify recording the Behringer RD-8 in Ardour8. It provides a method for selecting 'instruments' (i.e. kick, snare, etc.) and extracting their MIDI data from selected regions of an 'RD8_MIDI_Master' track containing a recording of the whole RD-8 kit. 
If no valid master region is selected, the script can be executed on the whole track. Moreover, there is an option to auto-connect the MIDI outputs of the created channels to the RD-8. You can also create audio tracks (mono) per selected instrument. 

#Other DrumMachines
Most of this script should be easily adaptable to other drum machines by specifying featured instruments and corresponding MIDI note values.
